## Purpose
 This project was created as a React Challenge for interviews.

## Challenge:
- [ ] To create a React app with 16 cards (4x4 grid) that have a back side with no color (gray) and front side with color (8 different colors)
- [ ] When 2 cards are flipped over with the same color they are marked as a match and remain flipped to colored side.
- [ ] Stretch Goals:
  - [ ] Remove the cards from the grid when they are matched.
  - [ ] Randomize the color locations with on load
  - [ ] Have a maximum number of chances
